    "This notebook demonstrates how the ``OpenAI`` function call works for the GPT models and how it can be used to programmatically interact with a Cisco device.\n",
    "\n",
    "For programmatic access to the router, this notebook uses ``pyATS``. This library unifies interaction with Cisco devices by using code to execute commands and parse output. This demo uses an IOS-XE router in an always-on Cisco Devnet sandbox. Please make sure that you can ssh to ``sandbox-iosxe-latest-1.cisco.com``. Location dependent (e.g., when on VPN) access might be blocked.\n",
